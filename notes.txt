#Setup
	*) Have your Raspberry Pi running Raspbian and connected to the Internet. I recommend to use a fresh install of Raspbian Jessie Lite without Pixel.
	*) Follow this Google Guide (https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/config-dev-project-and-account) and place the Google Assistant Credentials JSON in /home/pi/Downloads
	*) Prepare Amazon AVS Credentials as described in Step 1 in AlexaPi Installation Guide(https://github.com/alexa-pi/AlexaPi/wiki/Installation)
	*) Connect your audio peripherals (i.e. USB-Mic and Speaker via Jack).
	*) Clone this repository to /opt (This is important!)
		cd /opt
		sudo git clone https://github.com/xtools-at/AlexaPi.git
	*) Run setup and take all required steps
		sudo /opt/AlexaPi/src/scripts/setup.sh

#Audio problems
	If you're using HDMI, make sure to go to
	sudo raspi-config
	> Advanced Options > Audio
	and set the desired output (i.e. HDMI or 3.5mm Jack).
	
	Please refer to the following guides if you encounter any audio problems:
	Configure Google Assistant Audio Output(https://developers.google.com/assistant/sdk/prototype/getting-started-pi-python/configure-audio)
	AlexaPi Audio Setup and Debugging(https://github.com/alexa-pi/AlexaPi/wiki/Audio-setup-&-debugging)
